# Revision-Of-Python
This project demonstrates the usage of Python functions and important Python packages such as:
            1.datetime (Built-in module for date & time handling)
            2.requests (External library for making HTTP/API requests)
The project includes explanation and example code to understand how functions and modules work in real-world applications.
## Objectives
1.Understand how Python functions are created and used
2.Learn about built-in and external Python packages
3.Work with date and time using datetime
4.Make API calls using requests
5.Combine both modules in a real-time example
## Technologies Used
Python 3.x
datetime module
requests library
## Real-World Applications
      1.Fetching real-time data from APIs
      2.Logging system timestamps
      3.Automation scripts
      4.Backend API integration
      5.Data collection for analysis
